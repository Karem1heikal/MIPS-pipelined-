# VHDL-Pipelined-Mips-Processor
In this project, a 24-bit pipelined processor is implemented in VHDL featuring hazard detection and forwarding.
The processor includes a hazard detection unit to determine when a stall cycle must
be added. Due to data forwarding, this will only happen when a value is used immediately
after being loaded from memory, so data forwarding eliminates most stall cycles. The
hazard detection unit prevents the program counter from updating with its next value
to stall the program for one clock cycle.
